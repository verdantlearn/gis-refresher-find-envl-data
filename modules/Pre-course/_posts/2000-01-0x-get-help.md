## Where to get help
If you're having difficulties with any of the activities, the first place to post is 

`  **WHERE!!?**  `

Let us know if you're not sure what you should be doing at any point, and we will clarify.

You can also email your tutor on lucy.tallents@verdantlearn.com, but be aware that she may take up to 36 hours to respond, given time zone differences and her other responsibilities.
