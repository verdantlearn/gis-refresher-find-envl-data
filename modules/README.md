This folder is where you should put the content for your course. Every module in your course should have a subfolder inside this folder, eg. `setup`.

Inside every module folder, you should create a special folder called `_posts`, eg. `setup/_posts`. Inside the folder called `_posts`, you should create a file for every section in the module. The name of the file should start with the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-sectionname.md`. The date determines the order of the sections in your module.
