## Share known data sources
*10 minutes*

Your first task today is to share any sources of environmental data that you are *already* aware of:

1. **Add each data source** to a new row of the `Data providers` sheet of the collaborative spreadsheet below, including its url
2. Indicate what **types of geospatial data** are available by adding a *Yes* to the relevant columns
3. Add your name so your peers know who else has contributed

At this point, you only need to complete the columns in the `Data providers` sheet.  We will work on the `Datasets` sheet later in the week

If the embedded spreadsheet isn't visible below, you can [edit the spreadsheet here](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/uwavrR9MYDANOr7v0ECxdCFE) (**tip**: right-click the link to open in a new tab)
