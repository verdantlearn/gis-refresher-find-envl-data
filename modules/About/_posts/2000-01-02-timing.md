## Flexible learning

This GIS refresher course *Find and use free environmental data* will run for five days, from Monday 10th to Friday 14th May 2021

The learning activities should take you 3-4 hours of effort spread over five days of the course, depending on how rusty your GIS skills are and how much detail you want to go into.

- The **timing** of most activities is *flexible*, so you can choose when to study
- Tasks are arranged by day, so you could choose to spend 30-45min/day Monday to Friday, or you could complete all the activities in a single morning or afternoon
- We recommend that you **spread your learning** over several days, so that you can benefit from input and feedback from other participants, but it's your choice!
- The only activities that are timetabled are two **live sessions** (Zoom video calls); one on Monday and one on Friday.  These calls are offered at two different times to maximise your chance to attend, but if you're not able to because of other commitments, that's fine - just contribute to the shared collaborative documents when you can.
