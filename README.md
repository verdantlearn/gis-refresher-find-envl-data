## Actions

## Questions
- [ ] What licence do I have to implement on my own CIAB?  I have to share-alike template changes, but how about the content of my learning materials?  Ask P2PU
- [ ] How must I credit P2PU for my use of CIAB?

To make changes to the template itself, a good place to start is the [`_layouts`](/_layouts), [`_includes`](/_includes) and [`css`](/css) directories. These directories contain all the layout and style files used.
